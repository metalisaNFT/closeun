## Introduction

The conflict in South Sudan, which erupted in December 2013, has resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe characterized by widespread violence, human rights abuses, and displacement of millions of people. The United Nations (UN), through its peacekeeping mission—the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS)—has been actively involved in efforts to stabilize the country. However, the UN has faced severe criticism, including allegations of complicity in human rights violations and failures in peacekeeping. This analysis examines the UN's role in the South Sudan conflict, exploring these allegations and assessing the factors contributing to the mission's challenges.

## Background

### Formation of South Sudan

- **Independence**: South Sudan became the world's newest nation on July 9, 2011, following a referendum that resulted from the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement ending decades of civil war with Sudan.
- **Initial Challenges**: The nascent country faced significant hurdles, including underdevelopment, ethnic tensions, and political instability.

### Outbreak of Civil War

- **Political Rift**: In December 2013, a political dispute between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar escalated into armed conflict along ethnic lines—Dinka and Nuer communities, respectively.
- **Humanitarian Crisis**: The conflict led to mass atrocities, including killings, sexual violence, and the displacement of over four million people internally and as refugees.

## The UN's Involvement

### Establishment of UNMISS

- **Mandate**: UNMISS was established by UN Security Council Resolution 1996 in July 2011 to consolidate peace and security, help establish conditions for development, and strengthen the capacity of the South Sudanese government.
- **Revised Mandate**: Following the outbreak of conflict in 2013, the mandate shifted to focus on the protection of civilians, monitoring and investigating human rights, and supporting the delivery of humanitarian assistance.

### UNMISS Operations

- **Protection of Civilians Sites**: UNMISS opened its bases to civilians fleeing violence, creating Protection of Civilians (PoC) sites that housed hundreds of thousands of people.
- **Peacekeeping Challenges**: The mission faced logistical difficulties, limited resources, and threats to the safety of its personnel.

## Allegations of Complicity in Human Rights Violations

### Failures to Protect Civilians

- **Malakal Incident (2016)**:
  - **Event**: In February 2016, armed men attacked the Malakal PoC site, resulting in the deaths of at least 30 civilians and injuries to many others.
  - **Allegations**: Reports, including one from the UN itself, indicated that UNMISS failed to respond effectively to protect civilians, with peacekeepers allegedly retreating or refusing to act.
- **Juba Violence (2016)**:
  - **Event**: In July 2016, heavy fighting broke out in Juba, including attacks on humanitarian workers.
  - **Allegations**: An independent special investigation led by Major General (retired) Patrick Cammaert found that UNMISS did not respond adequately to prevent or stop the violence, citing a lack of leadership, preparedness, and effective command and control.

### Sexual Exploitation and Abuse

- **Incidents Involving Peacekeepers**:
  - **Allegations**: UNMISS personnel have faced accusations of sexual exploitation and abuse of civilians, including minors.
  - **UN Response**: The UN has a zero-tolerance policy for such conduct and has investigated reported cases, resulting in repatriation of implicated personnel and cooperation with member states for accountability.

### Arms Embargo Violations

- **Accusations of Inadvertent Support**:
  - **Claims**: There have been concerns that UN supplies or facilities were misused, inadvertently benefiting armed groups.
  - **Investigations**: The UN has conducted inquiries to address these concerns, although direct complicity has not been substantiated.

## Challenges Faced by UNMISS

### Operational Constraints

- **Resource Limitations**: Insufficient troops and equipment hindered the mission's ability to fulfill its mandate effectively.
- **Host Government Relations**: The South Sudanese government's obstruction, including restrictions on movement and delays in issuing visas, impeded operations.
- **Security Risks**: Attacks on UN personnel and facilities compromised mission effectiveness and safety.

### Mandate Limitations

- **Robustness of Mandate**: Debates over the extent of UNMISS's authority to use force to protect civilians created uncertainties.
- **Rules of Engagement**: Complex rules sometimes led to hesitation among peacekeepers in critical moments.

### Coordination Issues

- **Inter-Agency Cooperation**: Coordination between UNMISS and humanitarian agencies faced challenges due to differing priorities and operational approaches.
- **Diversity of Troop Contributors**: Variations in training, capabilities, and language among peacekeeping contingents affected cohesion and response efficiency.

## UN's Response to Allegations

### Internal Investigations

- **Accountability Measures**: The UN conducted investigations into incidents like Malakal and Juba, acknowledging failures and recommending reforms.
- **Leadership Changes**: Following the Cammaert report, the UN dismissed the UNMISS Force Commander for inadequate performance.

### Policy Reforms

- **Enhanced Training**: Implemented additional training for peacekeepers on the protection of civilians and conduct.
- **Mandate Revision**: Adjusted UNMISS's mandate to clarify responsibilities and enhance the mission's capacity to respond to threats.

### Engagement with South Sudanese Authorities

- **Advocacy for Access**: The UN continues to negotiate with the government to reduce operational impediments.
- **Support for Peace Processes**: Actively supports regional mediation efforts, including those led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).

## Conclusion

The UN's role in the South Sudan conflict illustrates the complexities and difficulties inherent in peacekeeping missions in volatile environments. While UNMISS has provided critical protection and assistance to civilians, it has also faced serious allegations of failing to prevent human rights violations and protect those under its mandate. Operational constraints, mandate limitations, and challenging relations with the host government have all contributed to these shortcomings. Addressing these issues requires sustained commitment to reform, adequate resourcing, and enhanced cooperation with all stakeholders to ensure that the UN can effectively fulfill its mission to promote peace and protect human rights in South Sudan.
